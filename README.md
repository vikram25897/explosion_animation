# Explode Animation

A Flutter package to create widgets with exploding animation.
Currently two types of animations are supported. More will be added in future.
Pull Requests are welcome.

Note : If you don't provide a list of colors then the PalleteGenerator package will be used which may take a lot of time to extract colors from a high resolution image.

## Installation

First, add `explosion_animation` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

No configuration required - the plugin should work out of the box.
